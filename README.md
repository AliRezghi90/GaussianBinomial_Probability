# GaussianBinomial_Probability
Gaussian and Binomial Distributions classes uploaded to PiPy

## Explanation:
you can use this package to calculate Gaussian and Binomial distributions of a data-set and plot histograms of the data-set:
  Instantiation example: 
    Gaussian_example = Gaussian() 
    Binomial_example = Binomial()


## Installation:
pip install GaussianBinomial_probability_dist03
